    <h2>This is a story all about how</h2>
    <p>My life got twist-turned upside down
      And I liked to take a minute and sit right there
      And tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
      In west Philadelphia born and raised
      On the playground was where I spent most of my days
      Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
      And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
    </p>

    <h2>When a couple of guys who were up to no good</h2>
    <p>Startin' makin' trouble in my neighborhood
      I got in one lil' fight and my mom got scared
      She said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air
      I whistled for a cab and when it came near
      The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
      If anything I can say this cab is rare
      But I thought now forget it yo homes to Bel Air
      I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
      And I yelled to the cabyo homes, smell ya later
      I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
      To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</p>
